Order and format must be followed exactly.

Skip.
(Bot ignores block. Replace with Start. to include.)
(Bot will silently rebind buttons where MSG-ID:ID_STRING is found, and reinbstate a button if its missing... This was a bug, but its now a feature)

Start.
(Begin a block.)

Toggle-Role
(User can toggle role by clicking multiple times. [Not working yet])

Static-Role
(User can only get the role once.)

CH-ID<#channel_id>CHANNEL_NAME
(Target channel for the message.)

MSG-ID:message_id
(Target a specific bot message. Auto-filled after running.)
(Remove the MSG-ID:message_id_string flag from roles.txt to push a fresh instance. This replaces the Replace-MSG flag from prior deployments.)
(The above is true now, due to an unintended function resulting in a bug where ther bot self sabotaged!)


MSG;
(Message content as it appears on Discord.)

EMOTE_x; EMOJI "Label"
(x = number. Use standard or custom emoji. Example: EMOJI_1; ðŸ˜€ "Happy" or EMOJI_1; <:NAME:ID> "Label")

MK-BTN_x; Colour=COLOR; [Emoji=EMOJI;] Text=LABEL
(Create a button. Colors: Red, Green, Blue, Grey/Gray, Blurple. Emoji optional.)

Give_Role_x; "Role Name"
(x matches EMOTE_x or MK-BTN_x.)

End.
(End of block. Start a new block with Start.)

date: Today (32/09/25)
Changed: Removed the Replace-MSG flag entirely fromt he regex and parsing logic of the roles.txt, please remove all instances of Replace-MSG fromt he roles.txt file, if not already done. 
The removal of the Replace-MSG flag allows for the rebinding of buttons and reactions where the MSG-ID:message_id_string is present int he header of the Start./Skip. block. 
The unintended result of this ius that where a Skip. flag is found, and a MSG-ID: flag is found below, the bot will use the on_ready() function to run the /rolemsg command logic flow to relink all buttons. 
the bug was where the Replace-MSG flag was found, it would only edit the text of the message, deletign the buttons/reactions and issuing a new message ID. The removal of the Replace-MSG flag (and all related logic) is that the intended functionality of the bot is achieved, while also
retaining the initial bug that made it impossible to properly relink messages or buttons/reactions to the message and reaction states/button states to the parent message. 
TL;DR: A bug is now a feature!
