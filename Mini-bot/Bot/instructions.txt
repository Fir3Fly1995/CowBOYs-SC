Order and format must be followed exactly.

Skip.
(Bot ignores block. Replace with Start. to include.)
(Bot will silently rebind buttons where MSG-ID:ID_STRING is found, and reinbstate a button if its missing... This was a bug, but its now a feature)

Start.
(Begin a block.)

Toggle-Role
(User can toggle role by clicking multiple times. [Not working yet])

Static-Role
(User can only get the role once.)

CH-ID<#channel_id>CHANNEL_NAME
(Target channel for the message.)

MSG-ID:message_id
(Target a specific bot message. Auto-filled after running.)
(Remove the MSG-ID:message_id_string flag from roles.txt to push a fresh instance. This replaces the Replace-MSG flag from prior deployments.)
(The above is true now, due to an unintended function resulting in a bug where ther bot self sabotaged!)


MSG;
(Message content as it appears on Discord.)

EMOTE_x; EMOJI "Label"
(x = number. Use standard or custom emoji. Example: EMOJI_1; ðŸ˜€ "Happy" or EMOJI_1; <:NAME:ID> "Label")

MK-BTN_x; Colour=COLOR; [Emoji=EMOJI;] Text=LABEL
(Create a button. Colors: Red, Green, Blue, Grey/Gray, Blurple. Emoji optional.)

Give_Role_x; "Role Name"
(x matches EMOTE_x or MK-BTN_x.)

End.
(End of block. Start a new block with Start.)
