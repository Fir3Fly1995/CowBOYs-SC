Functions order. The functions listed below must appear in the exact order and format of how they should apprear int he roles.txt file. 

Skip.
    (The Bot will replace "Start." with this, place new entries below the Stop. at the end. alternatively, replace Skip. with Start. to include it in the next push!)

Start.
    (always place at the start of a block)

CH-ID<#xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>CHANNEL_NAME
    (Tells the bot where to post the message. The CHANNEL_NAME [always caps] is for you to actually be able to read the channel itself.)

MSG-ID:xxxxxxxxxxxx 
    (Use the message ID if you want to target a specific message put out by the bot. Can also use witht he Replace_MSG command. The Bot will put this in automatically after running.)

Replace_MSG
    (Used to replace an existing message the bot posted. If you use this, you must use MSG;)

MSG;
    (This comes next in the flow. Enter your message as if you were typing on discord.)

EMOTE_x; UNICODE_EMOJI "Label" or <:CUSTOM_EMOJI_NAME:EMOJI_ID> "Label"
    EMOJI_1; <:SCSCULL:1408448147977670798> "Skull" - CUSTOM EMOJI
    EMOJI_1; ðŸ˜€ "Happy" - DISCORD_STD_EMOJI
        (This is a 2 pronged reaction role thing. you call EMOJI and _NUM [ties it to the role later] then semicolon space in Discord, click the emoji icon in the text field, then right click the emoji
        and click copy. Paste it into the document. Type a label as required.)
            (Method 2: do EMOJI_NUM; <: go to the emoji selection and right click the custom emoji. Select the emoji you want and note the name of it then copy the Emoji_ID. Type the name exactly how you see it after the : then close with : and
            paste the Emoji_id then close the >. It should look like tthe above example)

MK-BTN_x; Colour=COLOUR; Emoji=COPY_EMOJI_FROM_DISCORD; Text=button_label 
    (This makes a button. Defines the colour of the button as either Red, Green, Blue, Grey/Gray or Blurple (a mix of blue/purple), then attaches an emoji and a label. If you don't want an emoji, just leave out the "Emoji=COPY_EMOJI;" part entirely.)

Toggle-Role
    (this allows a role to be toggled by the user clicking multiple times.)
        NOTE: THIS IS NOT WORKING YET. I WILL FIX IT SOON.

Static-Role
    (The user can only interract once to get the associated role, subsequent clicks by the user will be ignored)

Give_Role_x; "Role Name"
    (The Give_Role_X is tied to the MK-BTN_x; and EMOJI_x; entries. this means that EMOJI_1; and MK-BTN_1 = Give_Role_1; "Put the name of the role here")

End.
    (This goes last, this tells the bot to move to the next Start. identifier)
    (you can start fresh with a new Start. line, after a line break)
