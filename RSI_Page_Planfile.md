# The official RSI Planfile, to make our org shine ont he international stage. 
The plan is to follow the IPEOR framework and hash out various ideas to make the Space CowBOYs shine. 

### What is IPEOR?
IPEOR is
    Intent - What you want to do.
    Plan - Make a plan for how you will do it.
    Execute - Follow the plan to completion. 
    Observe - Observe the thing in action
    Result - Take notes of the result then refine.

## History
What is our history, where we came from, and how we *battled.* Make it lore appropriate.

## Manifesto
Why we do what we do. How we will do it. Dont forget that we are doing it for to have fun and build a community of friends. 

## Charter
This is our constitution. As a syndicate, we must have rules that we will never break. These are Constitutional Rules (or laws, if you want to call them that). The Charter will protect low-ranked members from high-ranked members, will dictate what we consider as "Crossing the line" and effectively, our morals. 


# Suggestions.
### History 101: Stanton Edition
##### 2951-2954: Xenothreat Incursions from Pyro
	Since 2951 up to 2954 Xenothreat, a terror organisation kept breaching into Stanton, culminating in the Xenothreat Incursion into Stanton right before Pyro was brought online.
This could be a potential starting point
